Spavs: Stochastic Partitioning with Variable Selection. 

This R package implements a stochastic partitioning method to relate two high-dimensional data sets using a mixture of regression models with variable selection (Monni and Tadesse, 2009). The package provides functions to draw posterior configurations and to compute posterior probabilities.
