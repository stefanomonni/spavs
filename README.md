Spavs: Stochastic Partitioning with Variable Selection. 

This R package implements a method that can be employed to model and relate two high-dimensional data sets. 
Mixures of regression models are employed, with each mixture component consisting of sets of correlated responses and their associated subsets of covariates. The package provides functions to draw posterior configurations and to estimate posterior probabilities, as well as  a utility function to import into R the drawn samples for analysis.
